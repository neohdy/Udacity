# **Traffic Sign Recognition** 

by Neo He

## Writeup


**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Data Set Summary & Exploration


The data set consists of tens of thousands 32x32 pictures of German traffic signs. The original size of the data set is shown below:
* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is 32 x 32
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43
Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data...
